               **Abstract**

               There is an increasingly wide variety of organisations
               who are publishing Linked Open Data. The growth of the
               "Linked Data Cloud" is a staple of all Linked Data
               presentations and charts the early success of the
               community in boot-strapping an interconnected set of
               datasets across the web.

               There is also a wide variety of ways in which Linked Data
               is being published, including:

               .. container:: itemizedlist

                  -  simple statically generated RDF and HTML files
                  -  RDFa embedded in web application pages
                  -  As an extension to the principled design of a web
                     application that supports a rich variety of views
                     and data formats
                  -  As independent datasets dynamically generated over
                     data stored in triple stores, relational databases
                     or other data sources

               In addition data might be published as both a primary or
               secondary sources, e.g. as an RDF conversion of a data
               dump available from another organisation. The ongoing
               challenge for the growth and adoption of Linked Data will
               be in simplifying getting more data online, e.g.
               continuous improvement to tools, as well as the
               introduction of more primary sources that are commitment
               to publishing high quality, regularly updated data.

               Regardless of the source of the data or the means of its
               publication, there are a number of recurring patterns and
               frequently asked questions that relate to best practices
               around data publishing. This chapter documents a number
               of patterns relating to Linked Data publishing, and in
               particular how data can be made more discoverable, and
               over time enriched and inter-linked.

               While many of these patterns may have been discovered
               through the publication of Linked Open Data, they are
               generally applicable to Linked Data publishing in other
               contexts, e.g. inside an enterprise.
