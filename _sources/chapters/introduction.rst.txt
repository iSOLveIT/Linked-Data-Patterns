               **Abstract**

               There are many ways to help spread the adoption of a
               technology, and to share skills and experience amongst a
               community of practitioners. Different approaches work
               well for communicating different kinds of knowledge. And
               we all individually have a preferred means of acquiring
               new skills, or getting help with a specific problem.
               Reference manuals, tutorials, recipes, best practice
               guides and experience reports all have their role. As do
               training courses, mentoring, pair programming and code
               reviews.

               This book attempts to add to the steadily growing canon
               of reference documentation relating to Linked Data.
               Linked Data is a means of publishing "web-native" data
               using standards like HTTP, URIs and RDF. The book adopts
               a tried and tested means of communicating knowledge and
               experience in software development: the design pattern.
               The book is organized as a pattern catalogue that covers
               a range of different areas from the design of web scale
               identifiers through to application development patterns.
               The intent is to create a ready reference that will be
               useful for both the beginner and the experienced
               practioner alike. It's also intended to grow and mature
               in line with the practitioner community.
