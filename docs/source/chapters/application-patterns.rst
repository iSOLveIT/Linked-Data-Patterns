               **Abstract**

               Application architecture has always been a rich source of
               design patterns. Much of the design pattern literature
               covers useful architectural and code design patterns that
               can lead to the creation of more maintainable and
               evolvable software.

               We are still at the early stages of exploring how best to
               create Linked Data applications. Indeed there is still
               much debate about what constitutes a Linked Data
               application at all. Is it any application that uses RDF,
               perhaps entirely based on a local triple store? Or must
               it be an application that is capable of continually
               discovering new information from across the web of data?

               We still have much to learn about how to create
               applications that are truly flexible enough to process
               and display a wide variety of different data types. This
               covers everything from software architecture, design and
               user experience. Over time we might expect to see more
               research and development of Linked Data browsers. Or,
               perhaps web browsers will simply become more data aware
               and develop ways to help users make more of the data that
               is increasingly embedded in or linked from web pages.

               Regardless of the type of applications we are
               constructing, there are a number of ways that specific
               features of RDF, SPARQL, or HTTP accessible Linked Data
               can be exploited to create flexible software architecture
               or simply useful behaviour. This chapter captures a
               variety of design patterns that relate to a number of
               different aspects of application development.

               The existing patterns literature is at our disposal for
               helping to create Linked Data applications, but which
               features of semantic web technology can help us to better
               solve problems or meet requirements?
